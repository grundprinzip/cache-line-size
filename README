# Cache Line Eviction Simulator

This is a small programm that simulates the eviction of first level data cache
line when accessing it in a specific way.

The program uses the following constants:

CACHE_LINE_SIZE = 64
L1_SET_SIZE = 64
L1_ASSOC = 8
L1_SIZE = CACHE_LINE_SIZE * L1_SET_SIZE * L1_ASSOC

These constants are take from our Intel Xeon 3.0GHz Blade
